# Competitive Programming Toolbox  

This repository serves as a personal toolbox for competitive programming, containing reusable and efficient utility functions for common problem-solving needs. It includes implementations of algorithms, data structures, and templates to speed up coding during contests.  

## Features  
- Pre-written functions for common competitive programming tasks  
- Efficient data structures and algorithm implementations  
- Integrated **[PyRival](https://github.com/cheran-senthil/PyRival)** as a submodule for additional optimized algorithms  

## Usage  
Clone the repository along with submodules:  
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/omartrigui/competitive-programming
```

Feel free to explore, modify, and use these utilities to improve your implementation speed in contests! 🚀
